# Challenge: Changes in Sites

From the example we have been working on :
- Try changing the content of all the paragraphs on the page in one go.

Go to http://eir.ie

Use jQuery to :
- find out the font-family used for paragraphs
- find out the font family used for  <h1>’s
- change the text of each <h2> to your name

Go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page:

Use jQuery to change the following:
- background color 
- font family for paragraph
